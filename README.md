## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A friend of mine, made a joke about making a dating application form. Because of my bad luck with choosing woman. So I thought why the heck don't I make one. This project is simple and uses just basic front end HTML and CSS with some JavaScript to send a push notification. When someone Clicks submit.
